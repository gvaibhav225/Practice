    <h2> ABSTRACT </h2>
    
    1. <strong>Function</strong>  : An abstract summarizes, in one paragraph (usually), the major aspects of the entire paper in the following prescribed sequence: 

    <ul>
     <li>the <strong>question(s) you investigated</strong>  (or purpose), (<strong> from</strong> <a href="">Introduction</a> )
        <ul>
            <li>
                state the purpose very clearly in the first or second sentence.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
       </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>the <strong>experimental design</strong> and <strong>methods</strong> used, (<strong> from</strong> <a href="">Methods</a> )
           <ul>
               <li>
                clearly express the basic design of the study.
               </li>
               <li>
                Name or briefly describe the basic methodology used without going into excessive detail-be sure to indicate the key techniques used.
               </li>
           </ul>
           
          </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>the <strong>major findings</strong> including <strong>key quantitative results,</strong> or <strong>trends</strong> used, (<strong> from</strong> <a href="">Results</a> )
           <ul>
               <li>
                report those results which answer the questions you were asking
               </li>
               <li>
                identify trends, relative change or differences, etc.
               </li>
           </ul>
           
          </li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <li>a brief summary of your <strong>interpetations </strong> and<strong>conclusions.</strong> used, (<strong> from</strong> <a href="">Discussion</a> )
           <ul>
               <li>
                clearly state the implications of the answers your results gave you.
               </li>
           </ul>
           
          </li>
       </ul>
      
     Whereas the <a href="">Title</a> can only make the simplest statement about the content of your article, the Abstract allows you to elaborate more on each major aspect of the paper. The length of your Abstract should be kept to about 200-300 words maximum (a typical standard length for journals.) Limit your statements concerning each segment of the paper (i.e. purpose, methods, results, etc.) to two or three sentences, if possible. The Abstract helps readers decide whether they want to read the rest of the paper, or it may be the only part they can obtain via electronic literature searches or in published abstracts. Therefore, enough key information (e.g., summary results, observations, trends, etc.) must be included to make the Abstract useful to someone who may to reference your work.
